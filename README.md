This is a work in progress project of creating a turn based jrpg system within unreal

The aim of this is to just get the main battle system working along with having the different elements for making this into a working jrpg and to implement all of this in raw c++ 

in the current build of this, the gameplay ability system has been implemented along with the attributes on the player units and enemies. 
the UI for the party is implemented dynamically in c++ along with the target HUD being able to grab the enemies that can be targeted.
